# learning-opengl

This is a repo following my initial progress learning OpenGL following "Learn OpenGL - Graphics Programming" by Joey de Vries

### DEPENDENCIES:
**This was written and tested on a Windows 10 x64 computer. For MacOS and Linux make sure you install the proper versions of these dependencies for your OS.**
* [OpenGL 4.6](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) 
* [GLFW 3.3.8](https://www.glfw.org/download)
* [Glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/)

### Completed Projects:
1. Hello Window
    A graphics programming take on "Hello World." This program creates a simple window, with all the necessary dependencies installed and working properly, fills the window with the color gray, and will close when the user presses the "escape" key.

### Running the Projects:
#### Windows
Executable files can be found in the project directory in the "~/x64/Debug" folder. If the executable does not run, ensure you have the correct dependencies installed.
